# Task: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

## Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` which takes a number as input.
2. Calculates the factorial using a loop (or recursion).
3. Returns the result and prints it when the function is called.

---

## How It Works:
- The function uses a `for` loop to multiply numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The result is returned and printed by calling the function with a sample input.
